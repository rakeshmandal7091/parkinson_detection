          Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement and coordination. It occurs due to the gradual loss of dopamine-producing neurons in a region of the brain called the substantia nigra. Dopamine is a critical neurotransmitter that helps regulate smooth, controlled movements. As dopamine levels drop, individuals experience symptoms like tremors, stiffness, slowness of movement, and difficulty with balance and coordination. Parkinson’s typically develops in people over 60 but can also occur earlier in some cases.

          The exact cause of Parkinson’s disease is unknown, but research suggests that a combination of genetic and environmental factors may contribute to its onset. Certain genetic mutations are linked to the disease, while exposure to toxins like pesticides and heavy metals has been associated with an increased risk. However, no specific trigger has been definitively identified. As the disease progresses, it can also affect non-motor functions, such as mood, sleep, and cognition, leading to a wide range of symptoms beyond just movement.

          While there is currently no cure for Parkinson's, treatments can help manage its symptoms. Medications like levodopa help replenish dopamine levels in the brain, and other therapies, such as deep brain stimulation, may offer relief for advanced cases. In addition to medication, physical therapy and lifestyle changes can improve mobility and quality of life. Ongoing research is aimed at developing new treatments and ultimately finding a cure for this debilitating condition.
